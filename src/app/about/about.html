      I am a software developer from Sydney Australia who loves to write software to build great products and help businesses succeed with their goals.
      I appreciate good design and I am seeing it's importance more then ever in todays apps, web sites and products.
      I am an aspiring entrepreneur who subscribes to the lean startup ideology and creator of "positive affirmations", a app for Android.
