    <p>
      I am a software engineer who loves to write software to build great products and help businesses succeed with their goals.
      I appreciate good design and I am seeing its importance more than ever in today's apps, web sites and products.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been working professionally in software as a full-stack developer since 2015 in the web and desktop app spaces.
      From my experience I have learned advanced knowledge of developer applications, tools, methodologies along with best coding and design practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my spare time I occasionally dabble in web site development and learning new tech stacks.
