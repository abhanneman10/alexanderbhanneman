      I am a software developer who loves to write software to build great products and help businesses succeed with their goals.
      I appreciate good design and I am seeing it's importance more then ever in todays apps, web sites and products.

      I have been working professionally in software as a full-stack developer since 2015 in the web and desktop app spaces.
      From my experience I have learned advanced knowledge of developer applications, tools, methodologies along with best coding and design practices.
